- **主方法**（PST-DISCOVERY-v1 tokenizer 发现流程）— 未开始 / 尚未判定：旧Step5A0联合似然校准与A1有限合成正证据、Step5B实测teacher负结论保留。氧提取和已知尺度回归关闭；漂移越界已明确分类，遮挡感知算子已保留上下文并通过线性特征桥接检查。当前时序参考仍采用Gaussian近似，非线性Student-t时序推断及原训练边界的新同折实测比较尚未完成；全面UQ和tokenizer未晋级。
- **Token Atlas**（Atlas Statistical tier）— 已废弃（未完成且不再开展） / 尚未判定：Statistical tier 尚未运行；本旧分析支路废弃，不再开展。
- **对比实验**（六方法联合正式 campaign）— 已停止（此前已完成） / 混合结论：540/540 jobs 完成且无技术失败；42 个 cell 中 22 个可带注释报告、12 个数值被拒、2 个仅 overlap track、6 个不适用。
- **Croce 验证**（新版 Synthetic Phase 1）— 已废弃（未完成且不再开展） / 尚未判定：新版 Synthetic Phase 1 尚未开始；本旧验证流废弃，不再开展。

### Next steps
- **主方法** — 在遮挡感知观测合同下实现并校验非线性Student-t轨迹推断，覆盖完整、中心遮挡和整模态缺失；不得用静息点Gaussian参考或旧A0代替。满足该前提后，在原训练边界比较固定W=0/−0.5、同折线性基础/联合模型及配对/移位控制；不扩大GWZ或数据面板，protected 24–29保持关闭。

Start with the [generated project status](docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md),
[experiment sequencing](docs/EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md), and
[documentation map](docs/README.md). For manuscript work, use the
[paper evidence index](docs/PAPER_EVIDENCE_INDEX.md).

## Repository layout

```text
src/                    reusable data, inference, teacher, and tokenizer modules
tests/                  default software and shared-contract tests
experiments/            SSM diagnostics, reviewed configs, tools, and retained evidence
comparative_methods/    stopped method owners plus frozen comparison history
croce_validation/       stopped physical-model validation and derived caches
docs/                   authority map, concise contracts, and dated history
research_state/         single registry for execution and scientific verdicts
data/                   immutable measured inputs and owner-local derived caches
```

Start code changes with the [source map](src/README.md) and the
[entrypoint/config/test map](experiments/README.md#entrypoint-config-and-test-map).
New executable workflows go in `experiments/scripts/`; existing root-level
commands retain their paths. Local upstream references live in the ignored
`reference_repository/` and method-local `upstream/` directories.

Generated payloads are ignored except for explicitly retained evidence packages.
Active tools do not recursively search
archives, upstream mirrors, caches, checkpoints, or run trees, and comparison
packages write only to their own run roots. Frozen paths stay in place when reports
depend on them; directory cleanup is versioned rather than hidden behind
compatibility layers.

## Environment and checks

Use the repository environment; system Python is not assumed to be complete.

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pytest --collect-only -q
```

SSM synthetic and observation diagnostics are implemented; the next tokenizer
generation has no training launcher yet. A new implementation must own
its versioned config, synthetic checks, split contract, and output namespace rather
than repurposing an E0–E2 entrypoint.

Superseded code, configs, tests, plans, and local runs were moved to one
Git-ignored archive generation. Frozen evidence paths and the retained surfaces in
[`experiments/RESULTS_INDEX.md`](experiments/RESULTS_INDEX.md) remain in place;
no directory used by a live process may be cleaned.
